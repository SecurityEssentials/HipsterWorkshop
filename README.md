Cybersecurity is challenging for developers and product owners: we know we need it, but it costs us effort and money that we might rather use for other improvements. So, it’s vital that we make good, justifiable, decisions which security and privacy features we implement. But how should we best do this?

The Efficient Software Security and Privacy Workshop introduces ground-breaking research from the [PETRAS Hipster project](https://lancaster.ac.uk/hipster) at Lancaster University. In it, you’ll have a series of guided discussions with your team. In the discussions you’ll identify the possible security and privacy problems your project might face. And you’ll use powerful risk analysis techniques, along with industry-based information supplied by us. You’ll decide which cyber problems are important, how you might address them, and which problems can reasonably be ignored. 

The full workshop takes about three hours; at the end you’ll have a prioritised list of the problems, and ideas how to address them. You’ll also have identified ways to build on the same approach in future. Most important, it’s good fun, and you’ll learn a lot about risk-based security.
 
Anyone experienced at facilitation can lead the workshop, and we recommend inviting any of your team involved with designing and developing software, including developers, testers, designers, managers and product owners.

This package contains the full materials and instructions to run the workshop either online or face-to-face.
