# Hipster Workshop

Do you work with software developers in the Health industry? Are there important decisions to make about security and privacy? 

The HIPSTER team have developed a fun and engaging workshop to help Health (especially Health IoT) development teams to benefit from wider industry knowledge about cyber security. 

Anyone experienced at facilitation can lead the workshop, and we recommend inviting any of your team involved with designing and developing software, including developers, testers, designers, managers and product owners.

This package contains the full materials and instructions to run the workshop either online or face-to-face.

Download the current release of the package [here](https://github.com/SecurityEssentials/HipsterWorkshop/releases/latest/download/HipsterWorkshop.zip).
